## Abstract

The MicroProtocol (UP, U as the greek micro character) is an application-level protocol 
for distributed information systems. It is a generic, stateless protocol which can be  
used for simple data exchange between applications. It is strongly inspired by the 
HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

## 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

The MicroProtocol (UP, U as the greek micro character) is an application-level protocol 
for distributed information systems. It is a generic, stateless protocol which can be  
used for simple data exchange between applications. It is strongly inspired by the 
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), but has many features removed to keep it as simple 
as possible.

UP allows data exchange in a generic way between two applicative agents without 
extensive prior knowledge on the kind of data.

### 1.2 Terminology

This specification uses a number of terms to refer to the roles played by participants 
in, and objects of, the UP communication:

- connection: _A transport layer virtual circuit established between two application 
  programs for the purpose of communication._

- message: _The basic unit of UP communication, consisting of a structured sequence of
  octets matching the syntax defined in Section 4 and transmitted via the connection._

- request: _An UP request message (as defined in Section 5)._

- response: _An UP response message (as defined in Section 6)._

- resource: _A network data object or service which can be identified by a RRef (Section
  3.2)._

- client: _An application program that establishes connections for the purpose of 
  sending requests._

- server: _An application program that accepts connections in order to service requests 
  by sending back responses._

### 1.3 Overall Operation

The UP protocol is based on a request/response paradigm. A client establishes a
connection with a server and sends a request to the server in the form of a request
method, RRef, and protocol version, followed by a MIME-like message containing request 
modifiers, client information, and possible body content. The server responds with a
status line, including the message's protocol version and a success or error code,
followed by a MIME-like message containing server information, entity metainformation,
and possible body content.

Any UP communication is initiated by a client and consists of a request to be applied to
a resource on some server. This is be accomplished via a single connection (v) between
the client (C) and the server (S).

## 2 Notational Conventions and Generic Grammar

### 2.1 Augmented BNF

All of the mechanisms specified in this document are described in both prose and an
augmented Backus-Naur Form (BNF) similar to that used by RFC 822. Implementors will need
to be familiar with the notation in order to understand this specification. The 
augmented BNF includes the following constructs:

    name = definition

The name of a rule is simply the name itself (without any enclosing `<` and `>`) and is 
separated from its definition by the equal character "=". Whitespace is only significant 
in that indentation of continuation lines is used to indicate a rule definition that
spans more than one line. Certain basic rules are in uppercase, such as `SP`, `LWS`,
`CRLF`, `DIGIT`, `ALPHA`, etc. Angle brackets are used within definitions whenever their
presence will facilitate discerning the use of rule names.

    "literal"

Quotation marks surround literal text. Unless stated otherwise, the text is
case-insensitive.

    rule1 | rule2

Elements separated by a bar (`|`) are alternatives, e.g., `yes | no` will accept `yes`
or `no`.

    (rule1 rule2)

Elements enclosed in parentheses are treated as a single element. Thus, 
`(elem (foo | bar) elem)` allows the token sequences `elem foo elem` and 
`elem bar elem`.

    *rule

The character `*` preceding an element indicates repetition. The full form is
`<n>*<m>element` indicating at least `<n>` and at most `<m>` occurrences of element.
Default values are 0 and infinity so that `*(element)` allows any number, including 
zero; `1*element` requires at least one; and `1*2element` allows one or two.

    [rule]

Square brackets enclose optional elements; `[foo bar]` is equivalent to `*1(foo bar)`.

### 2.2 Basic Rules

The following rules are used throughout this specification to describe basic parsing
constructs.

    OCTET          = <any 8-bit sequence of data>
    CHAR           = <any UTF-8 character (octets 0 - 127)>
    UPALPHA        = <any UTF-8 uppercase letter "A".."Z">
    LOALPHA        = <any UTF-8 lowercase letter "a".."z">
    ALPHA          = UPALPHA | LOALPHA
    DIGIT          = <any UTF-8 digit "0".."9">
    CR             = <US-ASCII CR, carriage return (13)>
    LF             = <US-ASCII LF, linefeed (10)>
    SP             = <US-ASCII SP, space (32)>
    <">            = <US-ASCII double-quote mark (34)>

UP/1.0 defines the octet sequence `CR LF` as the end-of-line marker for all protocol 
elements except the Entity-Body.

    CRLF           = CR LF
